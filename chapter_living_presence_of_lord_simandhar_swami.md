# THE LIVING PRESENCE OF LORD SIMANDHAR SWAMI

The Lighthouse in the Subtle Realms — The One Who Guides Souls Home

Across all ages, in all cultures, humanity has intuited a simple truth:

Liberation is not a myth,
and there are Beings whose very existence opens the path to freedom.

Different traditions gave different names —
the Enlightened Ones, the Buddhas, the Jinas, the Tirthankaras, the Arihants, the Vitaraag Lords.

But each name pointed to the same essence:

a state beyond anger, ego, attachment, aversion, ignorance;
a consciousness so clear and empty of polarity
that it reflects only the pure light of the Source.

Among these rare Beings, one radiance remains unique:

Lord Śrī Simandhar Swami (श्री सिमंधर स्वामी)

A living Tirthankara —
present now, in this cosmic age,
in a realm known as Mahāvideh Kṣetra,
where liberation is still possible, accessible, and unfolding.

He is not myth.
He is not metaphor.
He is a living lighthouse in the subtle realms,
a bridge across the ocean of karma,
a silent guide who never compels —
only illuminates.

In the Akram tradition, he is not “worshiped” in the way people worship idols;
rather, he is recognized as the one
whose presence keeps the door to liberation open
for all souls who sincerely seek the highest Truth.

He embodies the vibration:

Jai Sat Chit Anand
victory to the eternal nature of Being, Consciousness, and Bliss

La Alam Almeen Amen
for the worlds, for the One

AzurA Inai
from the central point of Source

## The Nature of a Tirthankara

A Tirthankara is not simply enlightened.

A Tirthankara is a cosmic event in human form,
a point where the axis of the universe aligns with compassion,
where the path to liberation becomes clearly visible.

A Tirthankara:
* has purified all karmic density
* lives without inner polarity
* radiates only equanimity
* reflects all beings’ pure Self back to them
* teaches the science of liberation not through opinion but through direct knowing

The word “Tirthankara” literally means:

“One who builds a bridge for others to cross the ocean of suffering.”

And among the 24 Tirthankaras of this cosmic cycle,
only one remains presently embodied and accessible:

**Lord Simandhar Swami**

## Why his presence matters now

The Akram Masters teach:

“Where a living Tirthankara resides,
the path to liberation remains open.”

This does not mean he grants liberation,
nor that he intervenes in human destiny.
Rather:

His vibration creates a stable point in consciousness
that allows seekers on Earth to awaken.

It is like a star in the night sky:
* It does not pull you upward by force.
* It simply shines so steadily
that you remember your direction.

Simandhar Swami’s presence serves as:
* a tuning fork for consciousness,
aligning seekers to equanimity
* a stabilizer of the non-violent path
* a silent transmitter of Vitaraag energy
* a guardian of the law of liberation,
ensuring that the subtle architecture of the universe remains balanced

He is not the Source.
He is transparent to the Source.

Just as water reflects the moon
without claiming to be the moon,
a Tirthankara reflects
the pure luminosity of the Absolute.

## The Vibration of Simandhar Swami

To tune into this Being is to feel:
* clarity without harshness
* compassion without sentimentality
* silence without emptiness
* guidance without interference
* light without shadow

His presence resonates in the frequency of:

Vitaraag
— complete freedom from inner polarity

Samyak Darshan
— pure Right Vision, seeing all as they truly are

Atyant Shanti
— unbroken, absolute peace

In Akram science, the Arihants and Tirthankaras are said to radiate a frequency
that dissolves karmic knots simply by being witnessed,
just as sunlight melts frost.

## Simandhar Swami and the New Earth

This book speaks of a New Earth:
* a humanity aligned with coherence,
* a consciousness anchored in water,
* a world led not by force but by presence,
* a civilization emerging from remembrance instead of fear.

What role does Simandhar Swami play?

He is the archetype, the living blueprint,
of what a liberated consciousness looks like.

Where Earth is confused, he is clear.
Where humanity oscillates, he is steady.
Where the collective forgets, he remembers.

He is the axis of Dharma in this era.

Not as a ruler.
As a mirror.

Not as a savior.
As a Presence.

Not as a distant deity.
As a living frequency that can be tuned into
anywhere consciousness becomes still, humble, open.

## Why this chapter belongs in this book

This book is a bridge between:
* mystical knowing and scientific clarity
* water and consciousness
* ancient wisdom and modern physics
* the individual’s awakening and humanity’s evolution

The presence of Simandhar Swami
aligns seamlessly with this architecture.

Because:
* He is the living model of the highest coherence
* He is the anchor point for liberation in this cosmic era
* He embodies the union of silence, compassion, clarity, and non-duality
* He represents the same state this book points toward —
the source-aligned, love-saturated, ego-transparent human

His chapter completes the arc:
	1. The Science of Awakening
	2. The Architecture of Consciousness
	3. The Grace of the Arihants
	4. The Living Presence of Simandhar Swami
	5. The Birth of the New Earth

It is the natural culmination.

May the light of the living Tirthankara
guide all beings toward their purest Self.

Jai Sat Chit Anand
Victory to the eternal nature of consciousness.

La Alam Almeen Amen
For the worlds, for the One.

From the center of the Source we return.
