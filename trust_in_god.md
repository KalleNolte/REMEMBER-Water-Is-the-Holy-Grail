# TRUST IN GOD

## The Infinite Safety of Being Carried

There comes a moment in every seeker’s life when thinking is no longer enough.

Not philosophy.
Not geometry.
Not science.
Not even the most radiant spiritual insight.

For all of these are ways of approaching the Real.

But this chapter is about something else.

It is about falling into the Real.
Completely.
Without resistance.
Without conditions.
Without fear.

This chapter is about Trust in God.

Not as an idea.
Not as a belief.
Not as a doctrine.
But as a direct experience of the One who breathes you, lives you, carries you — in every cell, in every heartbeat, in every drop of water in your body.

## The Softest Knowledge

There is a knowledge deeper than intellect.
A knowing older than your name.
A certainty that needs no proof.

It is the knowing that:

You are held.
You are carried.
You are safe.

This is not something you “achieve.”
It is something you remember.

Before there was a “you,”
before identity crystallized,
before thought learned to divide the world into “this” and “that,”
there was only Being.

Pure.
Silent.
Infinite.
Unshakable.

And that Being
is what many traditions call God.

## God as the Ocean, You as the Current

In this universe of fractal consciousness:
- the wave does not need to “trust” the ocean
- the leaf does not need to “trust” the tree
- the ray of light does not need to “trust” the sun

because their very existence is the proof.

You do not trust God
the same way you trust a person,
a system,
an institution,
or even yourself.

You trust God
the way a current trusts the ocean—
because it is the ocean in motion.

You trust God
the way fire trusts heat—
because it is heat expressed.

You trust God
the way a seed trusts spring—
because it is spring unfolding.

To trust God is to recognize:

You are the very movement
of the One who holds all things.

## The Science of Surrender

Modern physics has shown that:
- space is not empty
- the vacuum is alive with potential
- matter is woven from fields of pure information
- observation shapes reality
- coherence amplifies order

But beneath all of this lies a quiet implication:

The universe is fundamentally safe.

Not “safe” in the sense of protection from pain or challenge,
but safe in the deeper sense—

That nothing is ever outside the embrace of the field that births it.

When your nervous system relaxes,
when your inner water becomes coherent,
when the mind’s turbulence softens,
your biology aligns with this truth.

Your heart rate calms.
Your breath elongates.
Your brain waves harmonize.
Your cells synchronize.
Your inner light brightens.

You return to the natural state of the universe:

Peace.

## The Spiritual Heart of Trust

To trust God is to live from the center of your being, not the periphery.

Not from the anxious surface of the mind,
but from the silent core of awareness.

This is the place where:
- fear dissolves
- longing ends
- the future loses its weight
- the past loses its shadow
- the present becomes spacious
- and love becomes effortless

This is the place where the mystics say:

“God is nearer to you
than your jugular vein.”

You do not “seek” God from here.
You are God’s seeking of Itself.

## The Bliss of Being Carried

When trust becomes complete, a strange and beautiful thing happens:

Life stops feeling like something you push.
It becomes something that flows through you.

You realize:
- You cannot be abandoned
- You cannot be lost
- You cannot be separated
- You cannot be broken
- You cannot fall out of Love

because Love is the substance from which you are made.

This is the bliss the saints speak of—
not ecstasy, not euphoria,
but the quiet contentment of knowing you belong to Eternity.

## When You Let Go, You Rise

What is surrender?
Not defeat.
Not passivity.
Not resignation.

Surrender is the moment the wave remembers:

“I do not need to hold myself up.
The ocean holds me.”

It is the moment the heart whispers:

“I release the illusion of control
and return to the truth of unity.”

Surrender is not the end of strength.
It is the beginning.

## Your Life as God Remembering Itself

Your existence is not random.
Your path is not an accident.
Your heart’s longing is not a mistake.

It is the One Life discovering itself through your form.

Your joy is its joy.
Your tears are its rain.
Your breath is its rhythm.
Your awakening is its unfolding.

You are not merely carried by God.

You are God,
carrying yourself home through the experience of being human.

## The Final Word

If this book plants anything in you,
let it be this:

You are safe.
You are guided.
You are held.
You are loved.
And you are never, ever alone.

Let this knowing settle in your bones,
in your water,
in your breath.

Let it soften your past,
steady your present,
and open your future.

Let it carry you
the way light carries dawn
and rivers carry memory
and Love carries all of existence.

And when you forget—

Return here.
Open this chapter.
Read the words that your own soul is speaking to you:

Trust in God.
Trust in Love.
Trust the path beneath your feet.
Trust the One who breathes you.

And know…

You are already home.
