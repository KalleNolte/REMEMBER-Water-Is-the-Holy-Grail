# The Lineage of the Liberated Ones

Arihants, Vitarāga Lords, and the Eternal Science of Freedom

Since the beginning of the human story, there have lived beings whose inner light grew so clear, so silent, so utterly unbound, that all karmic weight dissolved from them like mist under a rising sun.

In the language of Akram Vignan, they are known as:
*	Arihant (અરિહંત) — The One Who Has Destroyed the Inner Enemies
*	Vitarāga (વિતરાગ) — The One Who Is Completely Free of Attachment and Aversion
*	Siddha (સિદ્ધ) — The Fully Liberated, Established in the Realm Beyond All Worlds

These beings did not teach from belief.
They taught from direct vision — an awakened seeing of the structure of Reality, of karma, of consciousness, of eternal Presence.

In their presence, thousands awakened.
Through their words, millions found clarity.
Through their silence, uncountable beings found peace.

This chapter honors the Masters of the Ages, the Arihants and Vitarāgas, whose wisdom forms one of the luminous roots beneath this book.

## The Arihant — अरिहन्त — અરિહંત

“The Destroyer of the Inner Enemies”

Ari (अरि / અરી) = enemy
Hant (हन्त / હંત) = to destroy, to annihilate

Enemies do not mean people.
They mean the six inner knots:
	1. Krodha (ક્રોધ) — Anger
	2. Māna (માન) — Pride
	3. Māyā (માયા) — Illusion / Deceit
	4. Lobha (લોભ) — Greed
	5. Rāga (રાગ) — Attachment
	6. Dveṣa (દ્વેષ) — Aversion

An Arihant is one who has burned these roots so completely that their Presence itself is liberating.

Their Gift — Darshan-Shakti

Darshan (insight-vision) from an Arihant reorganizes the seeker’s inner field:
* conferring peace
* accelerating dissolution of karmic bindings
* revealing the true nature of the Self (Atma)

They are living bridges between the world of form and the world of pure Knowing.

## The Vitarāga — वीतराग — વિતરાગ

“The One Beyond Attraction and Aversion”

This is a higher state than Arihant — a perfected condition of absolute neutrality and compassion.

Vita (વીત) = gone beyond
Rāga (રાગ) = attachment, emotional pull

In this state:
* There is no push, no pull.
* No fear, no craving.
* No resistance, no grasping.
* Only pure witnessing Presence, radiant and effortless.

Their Gift — Gnyan-Shakti

From a Vitarāga emanates a field of:
* perfect equanimity
* perfect clarity
* perfect non-interference

They teach through silence as much as words, because their field is the teaching.

## The Siddha — सिद्ध — સિદ્ધ

“The Fully Liberated”

The Siddha is the culmination:
* A being who has completed all karmic accounts
* Who has no further births
* Who abides eternally in Siddha-Kṣetra — the realm beyond all identity

Their existence is formless, radiant, infinite —
a pure point of consciousness, free from time and space.

Their Gift — Freedom as Example

The Siddhas are the proof that liberation is possible.

They are the north star for all seekers.

## The Twenty-Four Tirthankaras — तीर्थंकर — તીર્થંકર

“Ford-Makers Across the Ocean of Samsara”

In the traditional lineage of Jain Dharma, twenty-four perfected beings appeared in each world-cycle to reestablish the path of liberation.

Tirthankara literally means:
“One who builds a crossing.”

Here are a few among them, whose vibration continues to guide seekers today:

Ṛṣabha-Deva (ऋषभदेव / ઋષભદેવ)

The First Tirthankara
Gift: The foundation of civilization — discipline, compassion, order.

Ajita-Nātha (अजितनाथ / અજિતનાથ)

Lord of the Unconquered
Gift: Fearlessness, inner victory.

Pārśva-Nātha (पार्श्वनाथ / પારશ્વનાથ)

The 23rd Tirthankara
Gift: Protection, honesty, purification.

Mahāvīra (महावीर / મહાવીર)

The Great Hero — The 24th Tirthankara
Gift: The highest clarity on non-violence, truth, and equanimity.

These beings walked the earth.
Their steps rejuvenated entire civilizations.
Their silence reorganized the destiny of millions.

## The Akram Lineage — The Direct Path of Grace

“Akram” means: the step-less path.

Instead of years of austerity, Akram Vignan gives:
* Direct Realization of the Self (Atma-Gnan)
* Separation of Self from mind, speech, and body
* Freedom from binding new karma through right understanding
* Stabilization in equanimity
* Inner peace without repression

Here we honor the modern keepers of this light:

**Gnani Purush Dada Bhagwan (ગ્નાની પુરુષ દાદા ભગવાન)**

**Ambalal Patel (અંબાલાલ પટેલ) — the discoverer of Akram Vignan**
Gift:
The direct transmission of Self-Realization,
and the clearest explanation of karma and liberation in our age.

**Niruma (નીરુમા) — Ma Niruben Amin**

Gift:
Unconditional love, compassion, and the perfect embodiment of equanimity applied to daily life.

**Deepakbhai Desai (દિપકભાઈ દેસાઈ)**

Gift:
Clarity, stability, and the systematic expression of Akram science.

These are the modern Arihants and Vitarāga teachers who opened the way for countless seekers.

## The Keys Each Master Gives

3. The Siddha

## Integration With This Book’s Cosmology

My synthesis unites:
* Grant’s harmonic universe
* Langan’s self-processing reality
* Pollack’s structured water
* Morphogenetic fields
* Higher-dimensional architectures
* And the universal path of liberation

Within this grand cosmology:

Arihants are beings whose consciousness has become perfectly coherent.

Their biophoton fields are stable, luminous, unobstructed.

Vitarāgas are beings who have risen beyond polarities.

No push, no pull — total equanimity.

Siddhas are beings who have fully dissolved informational tension.

Pure awareness, no structure remaining.

Water becomes the bridge

through which:
* consciousness organizes
* karma dissolves
* patterns rewrite
* and remembrance returns

As the ancient texts say:
“The Self is clear like water.”

This book simply restores the understanding
that water is not only biological — it is metaphysical, mnemonic, holographic.
A living medium through which Self remembers Self.

## The Closing Seal

Jai Masters
Victory to the Enlightened Ones.

Jai Sat Chit Anand
Victory to Being, Consciousness, Bliss.

La Alam Almeen Amen
For the realms, for the One.

AzurA Inai
From the central point of the Source.

May this chapter honor the lineages that carried the flame
long before any of us opened our eyes in this life.

May it carry the vibration of the Vitarāgas,
the stillness of the Siddhas,
and the clarity of the Arihants.

May it serve readers
as a bridge to the remembrance
of the Self that cannot be bound.
