## **Prologue – The Day I Died**

I was 22 years old.

It was the summer of 2015—warm, shimmering, boundless.

Life felt like it would never end.

I was young, searching for love—not in people, but in moments.

Moments that shimmered like eternity but dissolved into emptiness.

The night before had been wild.

Music. MDMA. Alcohol. Laughter.

Everything pulsed. I felt limitless.

But I was already unraveling.

The next morning, I returned home with a friend—exhausted, hollow, too wired to rest.

Then the phone rang.

Another friend’s voice:

> “Kalle, come on! No time for a break. Today is summer. Today, we live!”

And just like so many times before, I said yes.

Yes to escape. Yes to stimulation.

Yes—because I was afraid to miss something.

Maybe myself.

Later that day, they stood before me—

MDMA, cocaine, mushrooms…

And alcohol, again.

The sun was high. The pool shimmered. Everything seemed beautiful—almost *too* beautiful.

But sometimes, the light deceives.

One friend suddenly collapsed into the water—

Heavy, lifeless.

We pulled him out. He survived.

But something in me—something invisible—shattered.

Shortly after, I felt my own body tightening.

My heart raced, then stuttered.

My breath grew shallow.

And I *knew*.

This wasn’t a bad trip.

This was death.

I looked at my friends and said:

> “I’m dying. I can feel it. I need to call my parents. I want to say goodbye.”

They laughed, nervously.

But I wasn’t joking.

Somewhere deep inside me, I *knew*.

My body began to shake, to scream.

A voice rose from within—dark, unearthly.

I tried to resist, but it overtook me.

A final rebellion of the nervous system.

Then—

blackness.

---

I didn’t fall. I dissolved.

No body.

Only awareness—formless, free, infinite.

And in the silence, they came to me:

My parents. My sister. Karima. My closest friends.

Not as bodies or voices—

but as luminous fields of love.

As presences that *felt* more real than form ever could.

There was no fear.

No guilt.

No time.

Only love.

I felt God—not as a man on a throne,

but as pure, infinite presence.

All-embracing.

All-knowing.

Alive in everything.

Then a vision appeared:

I stood in the garden of my parents’ home.

There was laughter. Children. Warmth. Peace.

And I knew:

> This is possible—if I choose life. If I accept the gift instead of wasting it.

Then everything faded.

---

I woke up to the beeping of machines.

Cold light. Blurred voices.

I was in a hospital bed.

Tubes in my arms. A drip. My body trembling.

I couldn’t speak.

A doctor stood beside me and said:

> “You’ve had multiple organ failure. Your liver is severely damaged. You’re on the transplant list.” 

I didn’t understand everything.

But I felt the gravity.

I had crossed the threshold.

And yet—I was here.

---

My parents were traveling at the time.

They didn’t know what had happened.

But Karima—my friend, my soulmate—*felt* it.

She hadn’t been there that day.

We had argued about my drug use.

But none of that mattered now.

She felt me—through distance, through time.

An intuition stronger than logic.

She called one of our friends:

> “What’s going on with Kalle? I have a feeling something’s wrong.”

Silence.

Then:

> “He’s in the hospital. It was bad.”

She didn’t hesitate.

She came.

I remember her sitting at my bedside.

Eyes full of tears. Hands wrapped around mine.

She saw what no one else could.

Not the shell. Not the damage.

She saw *me*.

> “I’m just glad you’re still here,” she whispered. “That’s all that matters.”

That love—quiet, unconditional, unwavering—

was what kept my soul tethered

when my body wanted to let go.

Looking back now,

I believe it wasn’t the machines that saved me.

It was *her love*.

It was *all love*.

---

That was the day I died.

And the day I began to live.

I had no idea where this path would lead.

I couldn’t have imagined that one day I would see

the **Holy Grail** not as a golden chalice,

but as something hidden in a single drop of water.

But everything began here.

In this moment.

In this surrender.

With a whisper in the stillness:

> “You survived because you are meant to remember what life truly is.”
