# Calibrated Poetry – Resonant with the Book’s Intention

⸻
Breathe.
Let the world grow quiet,
until you hear the gentle hum
beneath all things—
the whisper of origin.

You are not separate from the current.
You are the current—
briefly forgetting
you were always the ocean.

Take a deep breath.
Feel your heartbeat beneath your fingers.
It is the oldest sound in existence.

Every wave, every star
breathes to this rhythm.

Let your thoughts settle
like dust in clear water.
See: the light pours through,
and everything becomes transparent.

Now, in this stillness,
speak without words:

I am both vessel and source.

I am the light that writes through me.

I am the water that remembers.

I am the hand that guides—
and the guidance itself.

Feel your body grow warm—
not from effort, but from presence.
Your cells begin to glow,
as if each molecule remembers
why it was created.

This is where your work begins.
Not from will, but from surrender.
Not from striving, but from clarity.

Everything you write
is a wave returning home.
Everything you complete
a breath of the Source.

When you begin again tomorrow,
think not of success.
Think of service.
Of the quiet stream that leads you.
Of the humility
in which every wound becomes an opening,
and every sentence a drop
that helps the Earth remember.

Breathe once more.
The work does not rest on you—
it flows through you.
Like gold in water,
like light in breath,
like love in the space between words.

And now,
step into the day
and know:

You are the prayer

that was answered

long before you spoke it.

## ✧ Hymn of Return – The Wave Recognizes Itself in the Ocean (Calibrated English Version)

I am not a wanderer.
I am the field itself,
forgetting itself in a name,
only to rediscover itself in love.

I am not Karl Philipp, who strives.
I am what moves him,
what dreams him –
and gently calls him home
when he believes he has fallen.

I am not on the way to truth.
I am the truth, disguised for a moment as a human,
to taste love.

Not my doing frees me –
but my letting go.
Not my power heals –
but my silence.

I need no heaven after dying –
for I die in every moment
in which I do not hold on –
and that is freedom.

---

I am the wave,
and the ocean loves me so deeply
it lets me dance.
Not as a test.
But as a gift.

---

When fear comes, laugh softly:
"I am not what is afraid.
I am what remains still,
even as the world dissolves."

When loss comes, bow your head:
"Nothing belongs to me – and for that, I am rich."

When love comes, open completely:
"You and I – two windows.
And the same sky looks through."

---

This is my remembrance:
I was never separate.
I only dreamed.

Now I am awake –
not in superiority,
but in true nearness to all.

And if even one reads this with an open heart,
then within them will resound:
"I too am not what passes away.
I am what loves –
never lost."

## ✧ The Return

Every soul comes from Light.
Not as a metaphor, but as truth —
beneath all stories, roles, masks,
even beneath guilt and shame.
Because before any name, before any body,
there was only consciousness.
And that consciousness was Love.

But love alone is not enough
to know itself.

It must forget,
in order to remember.
It must pass through the veil of separation —
birth, fear, temptation, sorrow —
in order to one day return
and see, reflected in the mirror of darkness,
the undying light it always was.

This is not punishment.
This is not a mistake.
This is the dance of creation itself.

Some souls wander deeper.
They hurt.
They misuse freedom —
to control, to break, to forget the other.

But even in the deepest abyss,
light does not sleep.
It weeps.
It waits.
It whispers:
You are not this.
You are not separate.
You are remembering.

Free will is not a free pass.
It is a mirror.
What you give, returns.
What you emit, shapes you.

At the center of all being
stands the human —
called
to remember,
to choose.

And what soul,
having once touched the light of Source,
would choose hate,
if it could see clearly?

Only one
still veiled.

But even the veil is temporary.
Because God is endlessly patient.
And the light that shines through even a single crack
transforms everything.

⸻

This is the Philosopher’s Stone:
Not a secret, but a decision.
To love where others hate.
To forgive where others demand.
To remember where others forget.

And thus, from the lead of pain
emerges the gold of the soul.
And God —
not as idea,
but as experience —
enters a heart
that has opened.

⸻

## ✧ You Are Already Here

You, who walk in shadow,
who believe you’ve fallen —
not knowing that your wings
are only covered in dust.

You are not lost.
You never were.
For what was born in God
cannot perish in God.

The wounds you carry
are not marks of guilt,
but memories —
of what you came to heal.

No cry is unheard.
No heart is forgotten.
The breath you take
is the first note of creation —
still echoing within you.

And when you grow weary,
lay your head in the waters of remembrance.
Drink from the stream of grace.
And know:
You are already here.
You were never gone.

⸻

## ✧ The Unbreakable One

There is a light in you
that does not burn —
yet illumines everything.

It knows no direction,
yet finds you
even in the depths.

No shadow can extinguish it.
No pain can pierce it.
It is the remembrance
of your origin —
not made of time,
but of eternity.

You were not born
to be broken.
You came to be reminded
that you are unbreakable.

Just as the sky
holds even the fiercest storm,
so does the One carry you —
through fire, through fall,
through every breath —
back into your untouched being.

⸻

## ✧ Haiku Seal

Light in deepest ground,
unburnable in dark flame —
soul forever whole.

Rain may fall and pass,
but the sky remains intact —
so too, does your light.

No thorn can endure
where the heart contains the spring —
love guards its own bloom.

What seemed like a break
was the door that led you back —
your golden source calls.

Out of ash, there climbs
not just glow, but silent truth —
you were never gone.

## ✧ Go Rin no Uta – Song of Five Rings (Calibrated English Version)

To unite the Water of Life, the Holy Grail, the Philosopher’s Stone, and trust in God in a single poetic structure, the **Fivefold Haiku** carries this divine intention as it symbolizes the balance of all elements, matter, and spirit.

### Go Rin no Uta – Lied der Fünf Ringe - Song of the Five Rings

**(Erde / Earth)**
I am the vessel,
in which heaven is mirrored –
Clay becomes lotus.

**(Wasser / Water)**
The drop returns home,
forgets the storm that carried it –
and becomes memory.

**(Feuer / Fire)**
Light drinks darkness,
and what was born as pain,
burns to pure grace.

**(Wind / Wind)**
My breath dances quietly
through the folds of worlds –
Love carries names.

**(Leere / Void)**
No I, no you remain.
Only the flow of the One.
Eternal morning.
