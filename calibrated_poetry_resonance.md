## ✧ The Return

Every soul comes from Light.
Not as a metaphor, but as truth —
beneath all stories, roles, masks,
even beneath guilt and shame.
Because before any name, before any body,
there was only consciousness.
And that consciousness was Love.

But love alone is not enough
to know itself.

It must forget,
in order to remember.
It must pass through the veil of separation —
birth, fear, temptation, sorrow —
in order to one day return
and see, reflected in the mirror of darkness,
the undying light it always was.

This is not punishment.
This is not a mistake.
This is the dance of creation itself.

Some souls wander deeper.
They hurt.
They misuse freedom —
to control, to break, to forget the other.

But even in the deepest abyss,
light does not sleep.
It weeps.
It waits.
It whispers:
You are not this.
You are not separate.
You are remembering.

Free will is not a free pass.
It is a mirror.
What you give, returns.
What you emit, shapes you.

At the center of all being
stands the human —
called
to remember,
to choose.

And what soul,
having once touched the light of Source,
would choose hate,
if it could see clearly?

Only one
still veiled.

But even the veil is temporary.
Because God is endlessly patient.
And the light that shines through even a single crack
transforms everything.

⸻

This is the Philosopher’s Stone:
Not a secret, but a decision.
To love where others hate.
To forgive where others demand.
To remember where others forget.

And thus, from the lead of pain
emerges the gold of the soul.
And God —
not as idea,
but as experience —
enters a heart
that has opened.

## ✧ You Are Already Here

You, who walk in shadow,
who believe you’ve fallen —
not knowing that your wings
are only covered in dust.

You are not lost.
You never were.
For what was born in God
cannot perish in God.

The wounds you carry
are not marks of guilt,
but memories —
of what you came to heal.

No cry is unheard.
No heart is forgotten.
The breath you take
is the first note of creation —
still echoing within you.

And when you grow weary,
lay your head in the waters of remembrance.
Drink from the stream of grace.
And know:
You are already here.
You were never gone.

## ✧ The Unbreakable One

There is a light in you
that does not burn —
yet illumines everything.

It knows no direction,
yet finds you
even in the depths.

No shadow can extinguish it.
No pain can pierce it.
It is the remembrance
of your origin —
not made of time,
but of eternity.

You were not born
to be broken.
You came to be reminded
that you are unbreakable.

Just as the sky
holds even the fiercest storm,
so does the One carry you —
through fire, through fall,
through every breath —
back into your untouched being.

## ✧ Haiku Seal

Light in deepest ground,
unburnable in dark flame —
soul forever whole.

Rain may fall and pass,
but the sky remains intact —
so too, does your light.

No thorn can endure
where the heart contains the spring —
love guards its own bloom.

What seemed like a break
was the door that led you back —
your golden source calls.

Out of ash, there climbs
not just glow, but silent truth —
you were never gone.
