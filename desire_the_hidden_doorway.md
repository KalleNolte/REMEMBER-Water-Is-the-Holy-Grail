# Desire — The Doorway Beneath the Doorway


*This chapter is inspired by the work of R.J. Spina, who understands desire as a guide to self-recognition—not as something to suppress or fight. The following thoughts and methods are an independent continuation of that inspiration.*

Desire is one of the most misunderstood forces in human life.

It is praised as motivation, condemned as attachment, feared as temptation, and idolized as destiny. Entire philosophies rise and fall around it. Some traditions seek to extinguish desire entirely; others attempt to fulfill it endlessly.

Yet beneath these extremes lies a far subtler truth:

**Desire itself is not the problem. Misidentifying its origin is.**

R.J. Spina’s work offers one of the clearest, most practical, and most compassionate frameworks for understanding desire—not as something to suppress or chase, but as a *signal*, a pointer, and ultimately a doorway back to consciousness itself.

This chapter explores that doorway.


## The Core Insight: Desire Is Never About the Object

In *Change Your Mind*, *Accessing Super-Consciousness*, and *Supercharged Healing*, R.J. Spina repeatedly returns to a single, radical premise:

> **No human being desires an object for its own sake.**
> What is desired is always a *state of being*.

Money is not desired for money.
Health is not desired for health.
Success is not desired for success.
Relationships are not desired for relationships.

They are desired because of how the person *believes they will feel* once the object, condition, or circumstance is attained.

Peace.
Freedom.
Worthiness.
Safety.
Love.
Expansion.
Joy.

The object is merely the mind’s current hypothesis for how that state might be achieved.

This single insight dismantles enormous confusion.

It reveals that desire is not inherently materialistic, selfish, or egoic. It is *directional*. It points inward—even when it appears to point outward.


## The Method: Drilling Down to the Root

R.J. Spina teaches a deceptively simple yet profoundly transformative inquiry process. It is not a technique of positive thinking, visualization, or emotional bypassing. It is an **investigation into causality**.

The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Identify a desire clearly.**
   Not vaguely. Not morally filtered. Honestly.

2. **Ask:**
   *“Why do I want this?”*

3. **Take the answer and ask again:**
   *“And why do I want that?”*

4. **Repeat.**
   Patiently. Without judgment. Without rushing.

At first, the answers are conceptual:

* “Because it would make life easier.”
* “Because I’d feel more secure.”
* “Because people would respect me.”

But if the inquiry continues, something shifts.

The answers simplify.
They soften.
They move from stories to sensations.

Eventually, the questioning arrives at something irreducible:

* “So I can feel at peace.”
* “So I can feel whole.”
* “So I can finally be myself.”

At this point, something crucial becomes visible:

**The root desire is always a state of consciousness that is already inherent—but currently unrecognized.**


## The Turning Point: Desire as Misplaced Identity

Here lies one of R.J. Spina’s most liberating contributions.

Once the root desire is uncovered, a further question emerges naturally:

> *“Is this state actually dependent on the external condition I assumed it was?”*

This is where transformation begins.

Because the answer, when observed honestly, is always **no**.

Peace does not require a different future.
Freedom does not require a different body.
Worth does not require external validation.
Wholeness does not require completion through another.

What was sought externally was never external in nature.

The external desire arose because consciousness had momentarily forgotten its own sufficiency.

Desire, then, is not an enemy—it is a *misdirected memory*.


## Healing and Desire: The Same Axis

In *Supercharged Healing*, Spina applies this same understanding to the body.

Physical symptoms, like desires, are not enemies to defeat. They are **messages about misidentification**—places where identity has collapsed into limitation, fear, or unconscious belief.

Just as desire dissolves when its root state is recognized as already present, the body responds when consciousness withdraws false conclusions about itself.

This does not require belief.
It does not require force.
It requires clarity.

When consciousness stops insisting that something is missing, broken, or incomplete, the system reorganizes accordingly.

This is not metaphor.
It is causality.


## Passion, Purpose, and Ikigai Revisited

Many people search endlessly for purpose, passion, or Ikigai as if these were external callings waiting to be discovered.

R.J. Spina’s work reframes this entirely.

Purpose is not found.
Passion is not hunted.
Ikigai is not assigned.

They emerge naturally when **desire is purified of confusion**.

When desire no longer seeks completion through objects, it becomes **expression** rather than grasping.

Action arises not to fill a lack, but to **share coherence**.

This is why true purpose feels effortless, alive, and grounded. It is not driven by urgency or fear of missing out. It flows from alignment.


## The Integration: Living from the Root, Not the Branch

The practical outcome of this understanding is profound:

* Desires lose their compulsive grip.
* Goals remain, but desperation dissolves.
* Action becomes precise, calm, and effective.
* Life simplifies without becoming small.

One still creates.
One still builds.
One still loves.
But no longer from hunger.

Desire is no longer a chain pulling consciousness outward.
It becomes a compass pointing inward—then outward again, *correctly aligned*.


## The Quiet Revelation

R.J. Spina does not ask anyone to abandon desire.

He reveals something far more radical:

> **Desire, when properly understood, leads consciousness back to itself.**

What was once a source of suffering becomes a guide.

What once felt like longing becomes recognition.

And what once seemed like a chase becomes a return.

In this way, desire ceases to be a problem to solve and becomes what it always was:

**A doorway beneath the doorway—leading home.**


### Placement in the Book (Recommendation)

This chapter fits **after** chapters on:

* Resistance
* Addiction
* Fate and Destiny

…and **before** chapters on:

* Assumption of the Wish Fulfilled
* Resurrection
* Ultimate Self-Empowerment

It serves as a **pivot point**—where striving transforms into clarity, and the reader is prepared to move from *understanding* to *embodiment*.
