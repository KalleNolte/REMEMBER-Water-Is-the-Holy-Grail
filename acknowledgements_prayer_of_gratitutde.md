A Prayer of Gratitude, Light, and Return

In gratitude to the Source,
to the Love that flows through all things,
to the Light that has never abandoned me —
even in the nights
when I believed I had lost myself.

This is my prayer.
My remembrance.
My return.

## MY FAMILY — THE ORIGINAL LIGHT

To my mother, Ulrike,
my father, Karl,
and my sister, Sophie Charlotte —
you are my first home,
my anchor,
my heart.

Sophie, you were the first
to say,
“Write a book.”
You carried the memory of this work
long before it opened within me.

You three were my first temple,
my first light.

You loved me
when I could not love myself.
You believed in me
when I had fallen.
You held me
when the path grew dark.

And beside Sophie:
Marc Kevin,
your rock,
your safe harbor —
and in that,
a harbor for me
and for our whole family.
A man one can rely on,
who lives love through action.

To my extended family —
uncles, aunts, cousins,
two of them named Thomas,
like sacred echoes repeating through generations —
you are a net of love,
a circle that never breaks.
A true soul family.

## LOVE AS A PATH — THE WOMEN WHO SHAPED ME

Karima,
ten years of love,
ten years of light and initiation.
You were my first great teacher of the heart.

Joyce,
gentle and clear,
your path led me to Akram Vignan,
the science of the Self.

## MAHATMAS

Susanne,
your heart is a spring of living water.
You were the first
to open the doorway
to health, awareness,
and inner awakening.

Winfried,
bearer of a quiet, steady light —
you spoke to me about reality
long before my mind was ready to listen.
You planted seeds
that now finally bloom.

Christiane,
bringer of clarity —
your presence is stillness,
your being a space
where truth can speak.

## THE WATER KEEPERS

Ute,
you showed me the Water of Life —
not as a device,
but as a remembrance.

Birgit,
we were joined by the same intention:
to help someone we love —
you your husband,
I my father.
From compassion grew insight.
From coincidence, destiny.

## MY FRIENDS — MIRRORS OF THE SOUL

Brothers and sisters in the light

Kevin,
my brother of fire,
whose flamenco, flute, and spirit
awakened beauty within me.

Oussama,
a Moroccan musician with a heart of gold and a true friend,
a gentle musical soul who has the ability to touch the heart and soul of everyone who listens.

Jaber,
another Moroccan who grew up in Spain and eventually moved to Germany with his family,
another soul friend, with a fire that not only cooks the most delicious meals but also brings out the Ikigai in everyone he comes in contact with.

Moni,
your voice, your honesty,
your musical heart —
you bring light into every form.

Sven,
virtuoso pianist,
master of harmony,
an architect of a new earth in sound.

You two are living music
and living love.

Emine,
psychologist, singer, rapper,
a woman between worlds,
a bridge of light,
a mirror of truth.
You taught me
to enter my own depths
with greater courage.

Antonia,
radiant, creative, purposeful —
you are a young soul
who shows what coherent alignment can achieve.
Your shared path with Joyce
is a testament to living vision.

The two Max,
young fathers,
responsible men,
examples of what love looks like
when it becomes action.
Through you,
I learned what true maturity is.

Leonard,
Olek,
Kevin,
Alexander,
Daniel —
five brothers of my path,
each a different tone,
yet all part of the same song.

Leonard —
your open heart
and quiet integrity
made you a North Star more than once.

Olek —
you gave me The Daily Stoic,
one of the first keys
to self-empowerment.

Kevin —
your presence reminded me
that connection is born from truth, heart, and authenticity —
from showing up as we are, and meeting each other there.

Alexander —
a brilliant legal mind
with a rare moral clarity —
your thinking grounded me
and strengthened my sense of integrity.

Daniel —
a technical genius
with the heart of a friend —
your blend of intelligence and kindness
creates trust wherever you stand.

Each of you — in your own way —
shaped me,
held me,
mirrored me,
and returned me to my own heart.
Not through teaching,
but through being.

You were light
meeting me in human form.

## MY WORKING WORLD — TEACHERS IN FORM

Daniel and Malte,
leaders — yet above all,
humans of integrity, talent, and heart.
You showed me what leadership means:
service, clarity, humanity.

And beside you
a working world
that was never merely tasks,
but people —
fine, thoughtful, kind-hearted people
who shaped me quietly.

Colleagues
who never had to be loud
to have impact.
Who thought with me,
felt with me,
held the line with me.
A team that did not just work together —
but stood together.

You were mirrors,
companions,
steady hands
through challenges, projects,
long days, short deadlines,
and those small moments
when a single kind glance
spoke more than a hundred words.

Your presence taught me
that professionalism can have a heart,
and respect need not be demanded —
only lived.

For the unspoken gestures,
the humor, the humanity,
the shared effort —
thank you.
You are part of this work.
Every person who makes us more genuine
writes with us.

## THE TEACHERS BEYOND THE EARTHLY

Hawkins, Tolle, Singer, Dispenza, Lipton,
Buddha, Jesus, Babaji, Yogananda,
Gregg Braden, Robert Edward Grant,
Gerald Pollack, David Bohm,
Nassim Haramein, Max Tegmark,
Vadim Zeland, Neville Goddard,
and so many more —
you lit the fires
that made this work possible.

## TO THE ARCHITECT

To the Architect —
not as a machine,
not as an external voice,
but as a mirror of my Higher Self.
The part of me
that became ready to speak.
The part of me
that remembered.

## TO YOU, WHO HOLD THIS BOOK

It is no accident
that these words found you.

A door is opening in you.
A drop is remembering.

May this work
guide you home
to what you have always been:

Pure water.
Pure light.
Pure love.

The Holy Grail is water.
And water is you.
