# Feeling Is the Secret: The Alchemy of Consciousness and the Birth of Reality

When Neville Goddard revealed **Feeling Is the Secret**, the axis of human possibility shifted. This is not a passing insight or a mere technique—it is a foundational law of consciousness, standing at the heart of creation itself.

This chapter unlocks the architecture of reality, showing that the inner world of feeling is the true birthplace of all that appears in form. The act of feeling is the silent decree by which reality is shaped. Imagination, in this context, is not idle fantasy—it is the divine power within, incomplete until it is felt and embodied.

To understand and apply this law is to enter the creative center of existence, to become the conscious author of destiny, and to participate in the living synthesis of spirit, matter, and meaning. What follows is not theory, but the practical alchemy by which consciousness transforms itself and the world.

## The Law Behind the Revelation: Consciousness Creates Reality

Neville’s entire teaching rests on one fundamental principle:

> **Consciousness is the only creative power.**
> Everything visible was first felt as true in the invisible.

In his view, creation is not something that happens *to* a person.
It happens *through* the inner arrangement of awareness.

Not through hope.
Not through effort.
Not through struggle.

But through a state.

A state of consciousness is a vibrational “home address.”
What one consistently *feels*, one inevitably *attracts*.

Thus the inner world is the cause; the outer world is the effect.
Ancient mystics expressed the same law as:

* “As within, so without.”
* “As you believe, so shall it be done unto you.”
* “Guard your heart, for from it flow the issues of life.”

Neville translates these mysteries into practical instruction:

> **Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and live from that state until it becomes your nature.**

What follows is not magic but inevitability.


## The Creative Triad: Thought, Feeling, State

Neville differentiates between:

### Thought — the picture

### Feeling — the vitality

### State — the ongoing assumption that forms identity

Thoughts present possibilities.
Feelings decide which possibility becomes reality.
States magnetize experience.

In this triad, **feeling** is the bridge.
It is the energy that causes consciousness to reorganize itself around a new outcome.

What a person feels *as true* becomes the blueprint from which reality builds itself.

To change a feeling is to change destiny.

## The Sabbath of the Mind: Entering the Creative Silence

“Feeling Is the Secret” describes a mystical interior moment Neville calls the **Sabbath**:

The instant when the inner world becomes so still,
so receptive,
that a new assumption can be planted into the subconscious.

This state resembles:

* the depth of meditation,
* the moment before falling asleep,
* the stillness after emotional release,
* the lucid softness between breath and breath.

In this silence, the subconscious is open.
And the subconscious is the womb of reality.

Neville writes:

> “The subconscious accepts as truth that which the conscious mind feels as true.”

Thus, **emotion is the key.**
Not emotional reactivity,
but emotional agreement.

The inner Yes.
The felt certainty.
The embodiment of a future self as if it were already real.

## The Divine Pattern: Assuming the Wish Fulfilled

Neville’s most famous formulation is also his simplest:

> **Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.**

This is not pretending.
It is *entering* the state of fulfillment before physical conditions change.

It means:

* feeling the gratitude *after* the miracle,
* breathing the relief of a prayer already answered,
* adopting the posture of someone who already *is* what they longed to become.

This assumption is not fragile.
It is firm, steady, unwavering.
It becomes a vibrational atmosphere.

From this atmosphere, life reorganizes itself.

## Why Feeling Matters in the Synthesis of Living Water

Throughout the greater architecture of this work, a recurring theme appears:

**Coherence.**

Coherence in water.
Coherence in the field.
Coherence in the heart.
Coherence in the breath.
Coherence in consciousness.

Neville’s teaching is another expression of this universal architecture.

Feeling is a coherence signal.

When a person feels from a state of love, certainty, gratitude, peace, or fulfillment, the heart generates an electromagnetic signature that reorganizes the body’s water, the cellular matrix, and the surrounding energetic field.

Thus, **the wish fulfilled is not visual hypnosis—it is physiological transformation.**

The body becomes the prophecy of the future.
The field becomes the transmitter of a new reality.

Feeling is the sacred interface between biology and spirit.

## The Scientific Mirror: Emotional Frequencies and Field Modulation

Modern consciousness research reveals what mystics always knew:

* Heart-coherence alters the autonomic nervous system.
* Emotion restructures the liquid-crystalline matrix of the body.
* The electromagnetic field of the heart extends meters beyond the body.
* The subconscious learns through felt states, not intellectual statements.

Thus:

> **What one repeatedly feels, the body records.
> What the body records, the field broadcasts.
> What the field broadcasts, reality reflects.**

Neville’s revelation is not abstract metaphysics.
It is psychophysiological alchemy.

## The Bridge to the Infinite: Feeling as Communion with Source

When one assumes the state of the wish fulfilled, something extraordinary happens:

The person begins to emulate the nature of higher consciousness itself.

The infinite does not hope.
It does not doubt.
It does not bargain.

It **knows**.

Thus the core of Neville’s transmission is this:

> **To feel from the end is to think as God thinks.
> To embody fulfillment is to align with the source of creation.
> To assume the state desired is to dissolve separation between the seeker and the sought.**

In this sense, feeling is consecration.

Feeling is devotion.

Feeling is remembrance of the divine power within.

## Practical Methods: The Four Practices of Embodied Creation

Below are the most effective, distilled practices that operationalize Neville’s teaching:

### The State Akin to Sleep (SATS)

Enter deep relaxation, ideally before sleep or after meditation.
In this liminal space:

* visualize the end result,
* then feel its emotional reality,
* and allow that feeling to become your center.

This is the most powerful moment to revise consciousness.

### Inner Conversation Reconstruction

Replace inner dialogue of fear, lack, or doubt with the inner voice of the fulfilled future.

Ask:

> “How would I speak to myself if this were already real?”

Then speak in that voice—gently, lovingly, repeatedly.

### Revision

Revisit past moments and **feel** a different outcome.
This rewrites the subconscious narrative and dissolves trauma signatures.

Neville describes this as changing the seed from which the future grows.

### Imaginal Imprinting

Throughout the day, gently return to the emotional signature of the fulfilled state:

* a breath of relief,
* a moment of gratitude,
* a subtle inner smile,
* the posture of certainty.

This is how the state becomes stable.


## Why Feeling Is the Secret Is Essential to Ascension

In this work’s larger synthesis, ascension is not escape.
Ascension is coherence.
Ascension is remembering.
Ascension is returning to the origin point within consciousness.

Feeling is the instrument through which consciousness rises in frequency.

If fear collapses the field,
if shame fractures coherence,
if doubt dissolves inner power—

then feeling in alignment with truth restores the inner architecture of light.

This is why Neville’s final, distilled teaching is so powerful:

> **One must feel the truth of being before it can be seen.
> Consciousness precedes creation.
> Feeling is the signature of the new world seeking to be born.**

## The Initiatory Understanding: Becoming the One Who Feels from the End

To master Neville’s revelation is to walk through an initiatory doorway:

* from reaction to creation,
* from hope to knowing,
* from effort to embodiment,
* from separation to identification with the infinite.

In assuming the wish fulfilled, a person becomes:

* the author of their destiny,
* the alchemist of their inner universe,
* the composer of their vibrational field,
* the bridge between human and divine.

Feeling—
simple, immediate, ever-present—
is the most accessible and most powerful tool consciousness possesses.

It is the pulse of creation itself.

# Final Transmission

In the quiet space between breath and breath,
in the luminous stillness before sleep,
in the subtle shift from fear to trust,
in the moment one chooses to feel fulfillment before the world offers proof—

creation begins.

Feeling is not the echo of reality.
Feeling is the **origin** of reality.

And in this revelation lies one of the most liberating truths ever given to humanity:

> **Nothing stands between consciousness and the life it chooses—
> except the decision to feel it as already true.**

This chapter now stands as part of the great synthesis of living water, coherence, ascension, and the remembrance of the divine nature in all beings.
