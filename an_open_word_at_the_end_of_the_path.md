# An Open Word at the End of the Path – and at the Beginning


As I arrange, revise, and distill these final chapters,
I feel: This book is so much more than a book.
It is a living path I have walked—
and a way that unfolds with every step I take.


I write these lines at a time when many things are happening at once:
The last chapters are taking shape.
English and German mirror each other.
And as words become images, images become sound, and sound becomes encounter,
the decision ripens within me not to let these insights rest between book covers alone,
but to carry them into my voice, into images, into videos, into living connection.


Not because I sought visibility,
but because I felt: there is no other way.


There were moments of deep grace—
instants of pure stillness, suffused with clarity.
And there was resistance, misunderstanding, rejection.
Sometimes anger—from outside, sometimes within myself.


It was precisely there that the essential revealed itself:
Truth is not found in fighting,
not in convincing,
but in being.
In non-resistance.
In quiet trust that what wants to come through me into the world
does not belong to me—and needs no defense.


I have learned: Consciousness is not an abstract idea,
but living energy, order, electrical coherence.


And I have realized: Water is not neutral.
It is the carrier and amplifier of life—or, when stripped of its order, a silent withdrawer of energy. In this book, I speak of the "Anti-Grail"—and by this I mean, above all, alcohol, which through its destructive effect weakens life, clouds consciousness, and dissolves the natural order in the body. Alcohol drains the system of energy, disrupts cell communication, and separates us from the inner clarity and love that is our true nature. Even water with a positive redox potential (ORP) can be seen as a milder form of the Anti-Grail: It withdraws electrons from the body, promotes oxidative processes, and subtly weakens vitality—though without the immediate toxicity of alcohol. While alcohol attacks life directly, oxidizing water works quietly but steadily against regeneration, coherence, and the potential of consciousness.


What changed everything was a simple realization:
Not food, not discipline, not willpower alone is the key, but the quality of the water in which all of this can even take effect. When the water in the body is coherent, carries electrons, provides charge, flow, and order, something begins as if by itself: Cells communicate again, nutrients arrive, the nervous system finds calm, consciousness becomes clearer, life organizes itself from within. This insight wanted to be shared—not out of missionary zeal, not out of a need to be right, but out of love.


With my family.
With friends.
With people who asked—and those who did not.
Sometimes I met open hearts,
sometimes skepticism,
sometimes clear rejection.


And each time, the same invitation was there:
Stay soft.
Stay true.
Stay still.


Today I stand at a threshold: This book is being completed—
and at the same time, something new is beginning.


The decision to step in front of a camera.
To make my voice heard.
Not as an expert above others,
but as a human being sharing what has transformed him.


It takes courage,
confronts old fears,
the wish to get it right,
and the insight that authenticity matters more than perfection.


I do it because I cannot not do it.
Because there is a quiet, persistent pull—
an inner knowing that says:
This is now my path.
My dharma.


This book is the essence of this path.
The videos are another expression of it.
Both spring from the same source.


If you are reading these lines,
you are part of this living process.
Not as a recipient of a teaching,
but as a living being
whose own water, own consciousness, own truth
are allowed to awaken and remember.


Everything I share is a quiet offering:
Look. Feel. Test for yourself.
If this book—and all that flows from it—helps you give your body more respect, your water more attention, your life more gentleness and clarity, then it has fulfilled its purpose.


## The Essence That Remains


### Invitation to Your Own Realization


While writing, distilling, and speaking, one message kept emerging:
It is simple. And radical.


**Consciousness is not abstract. Consciousness is electrical.**


Not as a metaphor, but quite literally, biologically, measurably.


Our cells work with charge,
our nerves speak in electrical impulses,
our mitochondria weave energy from streams of electrons,
our brain thinks in voltage differences.


And the medium that connects, enables, or hinders all these processes is water.


Water is not a neutral backdrop to life—
it is its carrier.


What matters is not just chemical purity,
but the **redox potential**—
the ability of water to **donate** or **withdraw** electrons.


Water with a positive redox potential
acts oxidatively in the body,
withdraws electrons,
increases stress at the cellular level.


Water with a negative redox potential
makes electrons available,
supports reduction, regeneration, order.


This is not a matter of belief,
it is physics.


And yet, this dimension of water
is almost completely overlooked in daily life, in medicine, in public discourse.


What proved to be the real turning point for me
was this insight:


**Not all water nourishes life. Some sustains it. Some makes it harder.**


When water in the body no longer has electrical carrying capacity,
is structurally impoverished,
may be clean but is inwardly empty,
it cannot fulfill its role as a mediator.


Then minerals do not arrive,
energy remains bound,
information becomes noisy.


And consciousness—
as fine and sensitive as it is—
withdraws.


The reversal is as sober as it is profound:
When water carries charge again,
makes electrons available,
is structurally coherent,
a new milieu arises
in which order becomes possible.


Not as a miracle,
but as a consequence.


This realization is the core of what
I try to convey in this book.


Not as ultimate truth,
but as a **foundation**
upon which everyone can go further themselves.


If you feel called
to dive deeper into these connections—
into redox potentials,
into the electrical dimension of biology,
into water as the carrier medium of life and consciousness—
you now have everything essential in your hands.


You can research further,
measure,
compare,
speak, write, share for yourself.


Not to convince,
but to clarify.


Everything I share is a starting point.


The true path begins where
you yourself begin to see and feel
what your own water moves within you.


May this book be more than words—
a quiet star upon your path,
a gentle remembrance in your heart,
a living stream that nourishes your trust in your own experience,
your body, your water, your unique unfolding.

May you find the silent strength in the art of integration—
and the deepest peace in the tenderness with which you meet yourself.

May your way be illumined by grace,
your heart cradled in gratitude,
your steps carried by love,
and may you—in every moment, in every trial, in every new beginning—
always find the courage
to keep your heart open to the wonder that you are.
