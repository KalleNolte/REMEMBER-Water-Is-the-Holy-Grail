# SHORT EDITION OUTLINE (ENGLISH)

This outline presents the **short, high-impact edition** of the book. It uses only a subset of the fully published chapters to create a complete but much shorter initiatic journey for readers with limited time.

The path preserves the essential energetic arc:

- Threshold & Seal →
- Origin & Awakening →
- Foundation in Water & Science (condensed) →
- Human Wound, Healing, and Return →
- Practical Keys for Daily Life →
- Forgiveness & Transmutation →
- Calling, Trust, and Final Remembrance.

Each entry links to an existing chapter file.
