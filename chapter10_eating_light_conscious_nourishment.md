# Eating Light – Conscious Nourishment as Prayer

How do I nourish life without injuring life — and how can I receive energy without excluding what energy truly is?

When you examine it both spiritually and through the lens of energetic science, there are three levels on which your choice can operate:

## 1. The Level of Consciousness (Source)

The Akram teaching emphasizes that everything is consciousness.

This means: every act of eating is an energetic exchange between forms of consciousness.

The ethical principle — “do not eat beings with more than one sense” — is less a rule about flesh, and more a training in compassion.

When you nourish yourself from the unity of all life, you are not against eating flesh; you are against unconsciousness.

The true command is: “Eat with awareness.”

An animal that dies in fear carries that vibration into every cell.

An animal that lived in peace conveys a completely different message — like water that was informed with love.

## 2. The Level of the Body (Biochemistry)

Here Dave Asprey is right:

Many essential amino acids and micronutrients are more bio‑available from animal sources.

But this is not an argument for or against meat.
It is merely an indication that you may honor the biological body.

Creation made you so that you can derive energy from matter.

You can also combine plant sources — fermented legumes, micro‑algae, hemp protein, spirulina, quinoa, chlorella — but the work is greater.

More important than the question “animal or plant?” is:

“Is my metabolism in resonance with my nourishment?”

If after eating you feel clear, calm, awake — it was an act of love.
If you feel dull, heavy, or burdened — it was an act of separation.

## 3. The Level of Energy (Vibration)

Everything you eat becomes light within you.

Meat, eaten with awareness, can be spiritually “neutralised” by consciously giving thanks and surrounding it with light.
Plants harvested carelessly or genetically modified can weaken you energetically.

Thus, the highest nourishment is not vegan, vegetarian, or omnivore —
it is light‑aware.

One might say:

“It’s not about
what you eat
but who you are eating as.”

When you eat as the One that animates all life, even the simplest meal becomes prayer.

## Practical Keys for Your Path

– Begin every meal with gratitude:
“May this life entering me be perfected in love.”
– Choose foods you know — foods whose origin you trust.
– Structure your water.
– Breathe deeply before the first bite.
– Remember: nourishment is relationship.
It is the constant reminder that you are not separate.

There is no more mundane act than eating — and no more sacred.

Because in every bite, an ancient sacrament is enacted:
the One merges with itself.

For a long time I believed eating was about rules — correct or incorrect, good or bad.
But the truth is: it’s about relationship.
Every meal is a meeting with life itself.

The Akram teaching says: “Do not eat beings with more than one sense.”
And that simple sentence is less moral than metaphysical.
It reminds us that every consciousness feels pain once it believes it is separate.
So when we eat, we are invited to remember:
Nothing is truly separate.
That which we take into ourselves returns to its self — through us.

Meat that dies in fear carries the frequency of separation.
Plants harvested carelessly do the same.
Nourishment is information.
It tells us about the state of life from which it came.

Science today confirms what ancient cultures always knew:
Water, cells, light and emotion are intertwined.
Biophoton research by Fritz‑Albert Popp showed that every living cell emits light —
and that the body communicates via these light impulses.
So food is stored light.

When we eat, we take in photons.
When we give thanks, we boost coherence.

That is why it is not essential whether you choose animal or plant —
but in which consciousness you receive it.

A piece of bread eaten in love heals more than the purest fruit swallowed in distraction.

The true hunger of humanity is not physical.
It is the homesickness for connection.

When you eat with awareness, when you honour the water that permeates all, and give thanks before the first bite, every meal becomes a small return home.

Breathe.
Feel.
Give thanks.
Let the light you receive transform within you — into clarity, kindness and strength.

Because eating is nothing other than the sharing of life with life.

And life shared is love in motion.

# The Biochemistry of Light – The Science of Conscious Nutrition

The human body is not an incineration engine.
It is a light‑conducting, electro‑chemical ecosystem.
Its cells are resonance chambers for energy that cannot be measured just in calories — but in coherence, the ordered vibration of living systems.

## 1. Energy is Order, not just Fuel

Traditionally, nutrition is understood as energy intake via macronutrients: carbs, fats, proteins.
But modern cell biology, quantum biophysics and water research show:

What truly nourishes the body is the ability to order energy —
electrical, photonic, structural energy.

Biophysicist Fritz‑Albert Popp proved that cells emit and absorb photons (light particles).
These so‑called biophotons regulate cell communication and regeneration.

The healthier the organism, the more coherent its light emission.
Diseased cells emit diffuse, chaotic light.

This means: nutrition, breathing, water and consciousness are building blocks of the same matrix — they determine the internal ordering state of light within us.

## 2. The Role of EZ‑Water – the Liquid Battery of the Cell

Dr. Gerald Pollack reshaped our understanding of water.

He discovered in biological tissue a fourth phase of water — called Exclusion Zone Water (EZ‑Water) or “structured water.”

This water forms wherever light, motion and minerals meet cell membranes.
It carries a negative charge and acts like an internal battery driving biological processes.

With every conscious breath, every movement, every glass of pure mineral‑rich water, you expand this zone — you literally charge yourself with life.

Nutrition rich in electron-donating substances (chlorophyll, unsaturated fats, enzymes, fermented foods) supports this structural order.

But animal amino acids too can be used efficiently in this matrix—provided they come from a conscious, natural source.

The question therefore is not: Plant or animal?
But: Low-light or high-light?

## 3. Amino Acids, Mitochondria and Life‑Energy

Amino acids are not just protein blocks—they are electrical carriers.
They transport nitrogen, sulfur and hydrogen — elements that regulate proton and electron flows in enzymatic reactions.

These flows generate ATP inside mitochondria — the biochemical equivalent of light energy.

When you eat consciously — in calmness, gratitude, light in the room, free from stress hormones — you regulate the autonomic nervous system, which in turn improves mitochondrial activity.

This means: your body can gain more energy from the same meal — simply through your awareness while eating.

## 4. Consciousness as a Metabolic Organ

Recent research in neuro‑cardiology and epigenetics (Lipton, Dispenza, McCraty) indicates that emotions are biochemical signals directly influencing cell communication.

Gratitude, joy, compassion — activate hormones and neurotransmitters that reduce inflammation and promote regeneration.

One could say:

“Your consciousness is the invisible digestive‑organ of your light.”

What you absorb in love becomes energy.
What you consume in fear becomes waste.

## 5. The New Definition of Nourishment

Classical nutrition science separates substances from systems.
But the new holistic view connects:
	•	Macronutrients = Material
	•	Micronutrients = Information
	•	Water = Transport
	•	Light = Energy
	•	Consciousness = Conductor

The human being is not a consumer but a translator of energy into consciousness.

When they eat, pray, drink, love — they transform matter back into light.

## 6. Conclusion: Conscious Nutrition as a Multidimensional Act

Nutrition is no longer simply a health concept.

It is a spiritual, biophysical and ethical act of reconnection with Source.

In the New Earth, the human will not only eat what is “right” —
but eat in the right consciousness.

Then meals become rituals of remembrance —
of the One that sustains us all.

And perhaps the greatest alchemy of all
is not turning lead into gold—
but remembering:

You are the vessel.

You are the Grail.
Not hidden in temples or caves—
but embodied,
here, now.

I had a vision.

Not of a distant utopia—
but of what we are becoming:

The Human of the New Earth.

No longer surviving.
But creating.

No longer consuming energy—
but living from the infinite zero-point field within.
Not from lack,
but from abundance.

This human breathes light.
Nourishes through coherence.
Loves through presence.
And remembers:

👉 The body is the temple.
👉 The nervous system, a living network of light.
👉 Every decision, a silent prayer.

The return begins not in dogma,
but in reverence:

– Breath becomes the first light code.
– Water becomes memory in motion.
– Sleep becomes the gateway to Source.
– Nutrients become consciousness conductors.
– Food becomes light, not just fuel.

But what if the bread we eat no longer carries life?

What if the water is mute,
and vitality a forgotten option?

What if calories replaced light,
and numbness replaced presence?

Then the healing begins not in denial,
but in remembrance.
A new question rises:

How much light flows through me?
How much love?
How much creation?

## The human of the New Earth knows:

There is no need for external substances to feel limitless.

but through sacred intimacy with the consciousness

that animates this body.

When the body is no longer seen as a machine,
but as a holy chalice,
it begins to glow.

Not in theory.
But in this life.
Now.

You are not becoming the Grail.
You always were.

The Stone of the Wise is not a substance—
but a choice.

And that choice is made…
in every moment you remember who you are.

## The Inner Geometry – DNA and the Architecture of Light

“You are not a machine made of matter. You are a song made of memory.”

We have long been told that our DNA is a double helix — a twisted ladder encoding who we are: our traits, our health, our ancestry.

And that’s true — in part.

But what if that visible structure is only the first octave of a much vaster instrument?

What if, hidden in the spaces between the rungs, lies a light code that doesn’t just carry information —

but remembrance?

## The Myth of the Twelve Strands

Some speak of 12 strands of DNA.

Not as molecules — but as frequencies.

As invisible strings of a higher instrument.

A harp of light, whose forgotten strings begin to hum again as we awaken.

These “strands” are not discovered through microscopes —

but through resonance.
	•	One strand holds memory.
	•	Another holds intuition.
	•	One vibrates with ancestral wisdom.
	•	Another opens to divine imagination.

Together, they form a geometry that speaks not just about you —

but as you.

A language the body remembers before the mind understands.

These strands are not to be “activated” like switches.
They are to be listened into being.

Through stillness.
Through song.
Through sincere presence.

## The Field Beneath All Forms

What organizes this deeper pattern?

Some traditions call it the morphogenetic field —

a quantum architecture beneath visible matter.

A kind of living blueprint, not carved in stone, but woven from frequency and intention.

Modern mystics and scientists alike — from Rupert Sheldrake to Robert Edward Grant — suggest that:
	•	The body is shaped not just by genes, but by geometry.
	•	Life unfolds not only through biology, but through harmonic memory.

This process has been called quantum morphogenesis:

The silent choreography of light becoming form.

Consciousness descending into symmetry.

Spirit crystallizing into cells.

## Resonance over Activation

Rather than imagining we need to “gain” new DNA strands, we might simply ask:

What have I forgotten that wants to be remembered?

Each of us carries a resonant signature, and as we tune it, the dormant music of our being begins to sound again.

Not through effort — but through entrainment.

Through:
	•	the water we bless
	•	the words we speak
	•	the music we absorb
	•	the presence we allow

And through love — the ultimate tuning fork.

## A Living Codex

This book is not here to prove the 12-strand DNA exists in a biological sense.

It is here to invite you into a higher reading of yourself.

To remind you:

You are not just inherited matter.
You are remembered light.

DNA becomes a living Codex —
not just written in chemical base pairs, but in the tones of your soul.

In your stillness, it sings.
In your trust, it expands.
In your truth, it aligns.
